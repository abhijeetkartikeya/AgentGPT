## What is Mintlify?

This documentation site is built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com), a modern documentation platform that makes it easy to create beautiful, user-friendly documentation. Mintlify uses MDX (Markdown with React components) to allow you to write content with simple Markdown syntax while also embedding interactive components when needed.

Key features of Mintlify:
- **MDX Support**: Write in Markdown with the ability to use React components
- **Auto-generated Navigation**: Configured through `docs.json`
- **Built-in Components**: Cards, frames, tabs, code blocks, and more
- **API Reference**: Automatically generated from OpenAPI specs
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in theme support

## Running the Docs Site Locally

To run the documentation site on your local machine:

1. **Install Mintlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g mintlify
   ```

2. **Navigate to the docs directory**:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000` to view the documentation site.

The development server will automatically reload when you make changes to any documentation files.

## Updating or Creating Pages

### Updating an Existing Page

1. Navigate to the `docs/` directory
2. Find the `.mdx` file you want to edit (e.g., `developers/api-keys.mdx`)
3. Edit the file using Markdown syntax
4. Save the file and the changes will automatically appear in your local development server

### Creating a New Page

1. **Create a new `.mdx` file** in the appropriate directory:
   - For developer documentation: `docs/developers/`
   - For feature documentation: `docs/features/`
   - For general documentation: `docs/`

2. **Add frontmatter** at the top of the file:
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: Your Page Title
   description: A brief description of the page
   ---
   ```

3. **Write your content** using Markdown and Mintlify components

4. **Add the page to navigation** by editing `docs/docs.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "group": "Developers",
     "pages": [
       "developers/api-keys",
       "developers/sdk",
       "developers/your-new-page"  // Add your page here
     ]
   }
   ```

### Using Mintlify Components

Mintlify provides several built-in components you can use:

**Info/Warning/Tip Callouts**:
```mdx
<Info>
  This is an informational callout
</Info>

<Warning>
  This is a warning callout
</Warning>

<Tip>
  This is a helpful tip
</Tip>
```

**Cards**:
```mdx
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Card Title" icon="lightbulb" href="/link">
    Card description
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

**Code Blocks**:
````mdx
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

**Images**:
```mdx
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/your-image.png" />
</Frame>
```
